# IÂ²C Tiny USB

This is my variant of i2c-tiny-usb from Dr. Till Harbaum. You
can find the original project on his homepage:

I modified the PCB schematics to fit my requirements and created
a nice case for it. The actual firmware for the ATtiny is exactly
the same. Instead of the ATtiny45 I used an ATtiny85, since it's
cheaper nowadays.
